                        grueling-time in my life. Since completing the course i've successfully switched careers,working

                        to help me learn programmimg step by step. i was encouraged to enroll by a former student of
                        theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. the entire curriculum and staff did
                        not disappoint. they were very hands-on and never had to wait for long for assistance. the Agile
                        team project,in particular was outstanding. it took my learning to next level in the way that no
                        tutorial could ever have. infact, i have often refered to it during interviews as an example of
                        my development experience. it certainly helped me land a job as full stack developer after
                        recieving mulitple offers.100% recommend! "</p>
